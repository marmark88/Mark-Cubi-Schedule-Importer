Hello! This is my project for CS2000 Lab Final

What I did for my project was create another class called student, which is derived from UniversityMember, and implimented >> and << 
operator overloading to read in a file of student name and course CRNs and store it into the Student class. The program then outputs each students name along 
with the CRN of the courses they are taking. 

Here are the things I think I earned credit for:
+1 << overloading (in the Student.h/Student.cpp file)
+1 >> overloading (in the Student.h/Student.cpp file)
+1 Inheritence (in the Student.h file, Student class inherets from UnivMember class)
+1 Uploaded and shared repository on GitHub
+1 (Technically used friend function in overloading << in Student.h/Student.cpp)

Thanks!
