Hello! This is my project for CS2000 Lab Final

What I did for my project was create another class called student, which is derived from UniversityMember, and implimented >> and << operator overloading 
to read in a file of student name and course CRNs and store it into the Student class. The program then outputs each students name along 
with the ID of the courses they are taking using the << overloading. 

Thanks!
